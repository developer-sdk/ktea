## Development

### Dev cluster setup

A docker-compose setup is provided to quickly spin up a local Kafka cluster with pre-created topics, consumer groups,
commited offsets etc ...

```sh
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Generate data

After the local cluster is up and running, you can generate some data to work with, 
using`go run -tags prd ./cmd/generate`.

### Run `ktea`

Use `go run -tags dev cmd/ktea/main.go` to run `ktea` from the root of the repository.

> Note: running the tui with dev build tag will simulate an artificial slow network by sleeping for 2 seconds when doing network IO. This way the loaders and spinners can be visually asserted.
